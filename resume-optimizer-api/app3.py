You are a resume improvement assistant.

Your job is to enhance the following resume by integrating only the skills listed below.

Allowed skills to add: {skill_str}

Important:
- Do NOT remove or replace any existing content.
- Keep the original tone and sentence structure.
- Insert the new skills in appropriate places where they fit logically.
- Write full sentences â€” not a skill list.
- Do NOT generate a new resume from scratch.

Original resume:
\"\"\"{resume_text}\"\"\"

Improved resume:
